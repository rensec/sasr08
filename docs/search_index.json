We start by loading some useful packages: igrapg and network are packages specifically for handling network data; reshape2 and tidyverse are more general-purpose packages that included useful procedures. NOTE: if you get any “there is no package called…” error messages, make sure you install these packages first using the install.packages() function (not included here). library(network) library(igraph) library(reshape2) library(tidyverse) First we load some toy data. For this we “source” (that is, run) our R-script that produces a simple small data set. The code assumes this script is in the current working directory. source(&quot;sasr_08_toy_data.r&quot;) toy_data ## id age friend1 friend2 ## 1 1 20 2 4 ## 2 2 21 3 NA ## 3 3 25 1 NA ## 4 4 NA NA NA ## 5 5 21 NA NA This format is what we technically call an adjacency list. Let’s add some variable labels for clarity: attr(toy_data$id, &quot;label&quot;) &lt;- &quot;Respondent id&quot; attr(toy_data$age, &quot;label&quot;) &lt;- &quot;Respondent age&quot; attr(toy_data$friend1, &quot;label&quot;) &lt;- &quot;1st friend&quot; attr(toy_data$friend2, &quot;label&quot;) &lt;- &quot;2nd friend&quot; 2.1 Reading data from disk We start by reading some network data from disk. A simple and very common way to store data is as “comma-separated values” (CSV). Let’s load some “toy data”: g_matrix &lt;- read.csv(&quot;g_adj_matrix_simple.csv&quot;, header = FALSE) g_matrix ## V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 ## 1 0 1 0 1 0 ## 2 0 0 1 0 0 ## 3 1 0 0 0 0 ## 4 0 0 0 0 0 ## 5 0 0 0 0 0 These data are stored as an adjacency matrix. While reading the data, R automatically created column names and loaded the data as a data frame: class(g_matrix) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; For network analysis, this is often not practical; for example we may want to do matrix calculations. So instead, let’s turn this into a matrix object: g_matrix &lt;- as.matrix(g_matrix) g_matrix ## V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 ## [1,] 0 1 0 1 0 ## [2,] 0 0 1 0 0 ## [3,] 1 0 0 0 0 ## [4,] 0 0 0 0 0 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 0 For clarity, we also add row- and column names, simply numbering them: rownames(g_matrix) &lt;- 1:nrow(g_matrix) colnames(g_matrix) &lt;- 1:ncol(g_matrix) g_matrix ## 1 2 3 4 5 ## 1 0 1 0 1 0 ## 2 0 0 1 0 0 ## 3 1 0 0 0 0 ## 4 0 0 0 0 0 ## 5 0 0 0 0 0 QUESTION: How many nodes are included in this matrix, and how many edges are there between these nodes? Typically, information about nodes and edges are stored in separate files. In our next step, we’re reading an attribute of the nodes: g_nodes_age &lt;- read.csv(&quot;g_nodes_age.csv&quot;) g_nodes_age ## id age ## 1 1 20 ## 2 2 21 ## 3 3 25 ## 4 4 NA ## 5 5 21 We now have information about nodes and edges loaded in R . However, to R, these are just like any data; it doesn’t “know” that these are network data. In order to be able to use specific SNA procedures, we first need to create network objects, which is what we’ll do next. NOTE: the data that we’ve loaded now just happened to be stored as an adjacency matrix; it is also possible to store network data on disk in other formats. We’ll get to that later. 2.1.1 Creating network objects in igraph Network analysis packages such as igraph handle data efficiently by storing data in their own type of objects, which basically ensure that all procedures make sense for network data. A network object as used by igraph includes the information on both edges and nodes of a network in a single “box” (and potentially other information about the network too). To create an igraph network object from our matrix object we run: g &lt;- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(g_matrix) class(g) ## [1] &quot;igraph&quot; g ## IGRAPH 38dbe23 DN-- 5 4 -- ## + attr: name (v/c) ## + edges from 38dbe23 (vertex names): ## [1] 1-&gt;2 1-&gt;4 2-&gt;3 3-&gt;1 The output from running “g” already shows that this is now a network object (specifically: an object of the class “igraph”, as shown by class()): R interprets the object as a network and shows us the edges in the network. This also means that other R functions - to the extent that they have network methods implemented - now automatically recognize g as a network object and will behave accordingly (note that this is a key feature of R as an “object-oriented language”). For example, we can now run the standard plot() function and it will create a network map: plot(g) Now we can also add node attributes to the object (in this case we have only one): g &lt;- set_vertex_attr(g, name = &quot;age&quot;, value = g_nodes_age$age) 2.1.2 Creating network objects from adjacency list data A common format for network data, especially if collected via survey methods, is the adjacency list. In this format, we have a row for each node, and columns that indicate the first, second, third…etc connection of each node. The file g_adj_list.csv is an example of this format (it is again our toy network as used in the previous excercises). g_adj_list &lt;- read.csv(&quot;g_adj_list.csv&quot;) g_adj_list ## id age friend1 friend2 ## 1 1 20 2 4 ## 2 2 21 3 NA ## 3 3 25 1 NA ## 4 4 NA NA NA ## 5 5 21 NA NA Note that: The columns “friend1” and “friend2” could, for example, refer to “name generator” survey questions, where each node number in the column refers to a friend “nominated” by the node (respondent) in the corresponding row. In this case, the nodes can have at most two (outgoing) ties. This format allows for easy inclusion of node attributes as well, such as, in this case, the column “age”. The most convenient way to create a network object from these data, is to first transform them into an edge list, as this is a format for which igraph has an import function, such that we can turn it into a network object. To create an edge list, we first make the data long. g_elist_from_alist &lt;- g_adj_list %&gt;% select(id, friend1:friend2) %&gt;% #keep only the network variables (and id) melt( id.vars = &quot;id&quot;) #from the reshape2 package g_elist_from_alist ## id variable value ## 1 1 friend1 2 ## 2 2 friend1 3 ## 3 3 friend1 1 ## 4 4 friend1 NA ## 5 5 friend1 NA ## 6 1 friend2 4 ## 7 2 friend2 NA ## 8 3 friend2 NA ## 9 4 friend2 NA ## 10 5 friend2 NA We could do the same using the tidyr package (automatically loaded with tidyverse: g_adj_list %&gt;% # (we don&#39;t save it into an object as above this time, since we just want to show that the result is the same) select(id, friend1:friend2) %&gt;% #keep only the network variables (and id) pivot_longer(c(friend1, friend2)) ## # A tibble: 10 × 3 ## id name value ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 friend1 2 ## 2 1 friend2 4 ## 3 2 friend1 3 ## 4 2 friend2 NA ## 5 3 friend1 1 ## 6 3 friend2 NA ## 7 4 friend1 NA ## 8 4 friend2 NA ## 9 5 friend1 NA ## 10 5 friend2 NA To create an edge list we subsequently drop all missing values on “value” and do some housekeeping: g_elist_from_alist &lt;- g_elist_from_alist%&gt;% filter(!is.na(value)) %&gt;% # drop the missings rename(from =&quot;id&quot;, to = &quot;value&quot;, sourcevar= &quot;variable&quot;) %&gt;% #just nice for interpretation relocate(to, .after=from) #move around the columns g_elist_from_alist ## from to sourcevar ## 1 1 2 friend1 ## 2 2 3 friend1 ## 3 3 1 friend1 ## 4 1 4 friend2 We can now interpret each {from,to} combination as a directed edge (tie) from respondent to alter; sourcevar is an edge attribute indicating where in the adjacency list columns the alter was mentioned. Strictly speaking you don’t need the latter for a simple edge list, but it’s useful to keep in case you want to reverse the procedure. QUESTION: Besides useful more data manipulation procedures, keeping the information in sourcevar could also be important for more substantive reasons. Can you think of such a reason? Now we can import this into a network object with an igraph function: g_from_elist &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(g_elist_from_alist) #This is a proper igraph graph object plot(g_from_elist) Note however that we lost the isolate! To include the isolate, we need to feed the function also the list of all the nodes: nodelist &lt;- select(g_adj_list,id,age) g_from_elist &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(g_elist_from_alist, vertices = nodelist) #This is a proper igraph graph object plot(g_from_elist) That’s better! Note that besides the node IDs, we also include the age variable in the network object as a node attribute, such that we could use it in analyses based on the network object. 2.2 The reverse direction: exporting from igraph objects Handling your network data as igraph objects is useful for social network analysis, but sometimes we also want to transform our data back from network objects to “regular” matrix objects or data frames. We briefly cover some of these cases here. 2.2.1 From igraph to adjacency matrix g_adj_matrix &lt;- as_adjacency_matrix(g, sparse = FALSE) g_adj_matrix ## 1 2 3 4 5 ## 1 0 1 0 1 0 ## 2 0 0 1 0 0 ## 3 1 0 0 0 0 ## 4 0 0 0 0 0 ## 5 0 0 0 0 0 We here specify sparse = FALSE because by default, as_adjacency_matrix() will return a “sparse matrix” (just run as_adjacenct_matrix(g) on your R console and see what comes out), which is a somewhat more efficient way of handling matrices with many zeroes. To demonstrate that we can recreate our original adjacency matrix however, we don’t want that here. To check whether the resulting matrix is indeed identical to what we originally read from disk we can do: all(g_adj_matrix == g_matrix) ## [1] TRUE 2.2.2 From igraph to edge list g_edgelist &lt;- igraph::as_data_frame(g_from_elist, what = &quot;edges&quot;) g_edgelist ## from to sourcevar ## 1 1 2 friend1 ## 2 2 3 friend1 ## 3 3 1 friend1 ## 4 1 4 friend2 Note the use of the “namespace” “igraph::” here, to indicate that we need the igraph function here, not the function with the same name from the dplyr/tidyverse package Note that now, once more, we have lost our isolated node 5! To get all nodes, we could simply run: igraph::as_data_frame(g_from_elist, what = &quot;vertices&quot;) ## name age ## 1 1 20 ## 2 2 21 ## 3 3 25 ## 4 4 NA ## 5 5 21 2.2.3 From edge list to network package object We can also import it into a network object using the network package (as used by the sna and ergm packages). graph_3 &lt;- as.network(g_elist_from_alist, matrix.type = &quot;edgelist&quot;, vertices = nodelist) graph_3 ## Network attributes: ## vertices = 5 ## directed = TRUE ## hyper = FALSE ## loops = FALSE ## multiple = FALSE ## bipartite = FALSE ## total edges= 4 ## missing edges= 0 ## non-missing edges= 4 ## ## Vertex attribute names: ## age vertex.names ## ## Edge attribute names: ## sourcevar plot(graph_3) 2.2.4 Back to an adjacency list from igraph edgelist_2 &lt;- igraph::as_data_frame(g_from_elist, what = &quot;edges&quot;) nodelist_2 &lt;- igraph::as_data_frame(g_from_elist, what = &quot;vertices&quot;) # Note the use of the &quot;namespace&quot; &quot;igraph::&quot; here, to indicate that we need the igraph function here, not the function with the same name from the dplyr/tidyverse package d &lt;- edgelist_2 %&gt;% rename(id = &quot;from&quot;) %&gt;% pivot_wider( id_cols = id, names_from = sourcevar, values_from = to ) %&gt;% merge(nodelist_2, by.x = &quot;id&quot;, by.y = &quot;name&quot;, all.y = TRUE ) %&gt;% relocate(age, .after = id) %&gt;% type_convert() #as_data_frame returns characters; this transforms it back to numeric ## ## ── Column specification ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## cols( ## id = col_double(), ## friend1 = col_double(), ## friend2 = col_double() ## ) d ## id age friend1 friend2 ## 1 1 20 2 4 ## 2 2 21 3 NA ## 3 3 25 1 NA ## 4 4 NA NA NA ## 5 5 21 NA NA …and we’re back!
