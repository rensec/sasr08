# Preamble

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


```{r}

library(haven) #For reading Stata files
library(network) #For data handling of network data 
library(xUCINET)
library(tidyverse) # because Tidyverse!


```

# Data preparation

As before, we take one class out of the entire dataset, select the friendship network variables, and turn them into a network object. This time, for convencience, we first filter out the one class and keep it as a separate data frame.

```{r}


PupilsWaveV <- read_dta(file = "PupilsWaveV.dta")
class12b <- PupilsWaveV  %>% 
  filter(schoolnr == "12b")  # keep only one class

m <- class12b %>% 
  select(namenr, friend1:friend12)  # select only the " best friends"  network

m <- as.matrix(m)  # so that the next line works as intended; cbind() works in specific ways on matrix objects, which we exploit here.

m<- cbind(m[,1],c(m[,-1])) %>% 
  as_tibble(m) %>% # So that we can easily filter 
  filter(!is.na(V2)) # Now it is an edge list



g <- as.network.matrix(m,matrix.type = "edgelist") #from network package  

```


We can also add some attributes:
```{r}

gender <- select(class12b, sex)  # select only the " best friends"  network


g %v% "Gender"<- gender
g
```

```{r}
gplot(g,  vertex.col=g %v% "Gender"*2)
```
Looks like we have some gender homophily going on here, as well as a lot of reciprocity! With ERGM, we can test this statistically.  

# Model estimation

Now let's estimate a simple model. First we test the hypothesis that ties are likely to be reciprocated. In this case we add, besides the "edges"  term, 

```{r}
M1.g<-ergm(g ~ edges +  mutual )

summary(M1.g)
```
Indeed, we find a positive and significant effect for the number of reciprocated ties. 

Now let's add the homphily effect (as well as a gender differential effect):

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
M2.g<-ergm(g ~ edges + mutual +  nodefactor("Gender", levels = 2) + nodematch("Gender" ))

summary(M2.g)


```
Indeed, we find a positive effect of gender homophily. 

Finally, let's look at goodness of fit: 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
M2.g.gof <- gof(M2.g)
M2.g.gof
```
This looks OK for the model statistics, but less so for the for network statistics *not* in the model. Let's have a closer look at those:

```{r}
plot(M2.g.gof)
```

Indeed, some of these are quite off, indicating that we might want to include some other effects in the model. Indeed, for directed networks, it is common to include at least indegree-, outdegree-, reciprocity, and something related to triadic closure. The exact choice of effects is not trivial though, so we leave it at this for now.
