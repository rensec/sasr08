# About {.unnumbered}

This page contains tutorials for the Utrecht University course SaSR 8/Research practicum 2: Social network analysis (200400071).

## Usage {.unnumbered}

To use these tutorials, we suggest that you:

-   Open a new R script;
-   Copy-paste the code from the tutorials into your R script as you read along;
-   Run the code from your script while reading along, to verify that your results are the same;
-   Afterwards, save your R-script under an informative name so that you can refer to it and reuse it later. A big part of effective data analysis is realizing that you've solved particular problems before and being able to find and recycle your earlier code!

## Credits and further resources {-}

There are many excellent tutorials for social network analysis in R, and the tutorials on this page is inspired by and builds on some of them. Particularly useful were:

-   The [tutorials](https://inarwhal.github.io/NetworkAnalysisR-book/) that accompany the book *Network Analysis: Integrating Social Network Theory, Method, and Application with R* by Craig Rawlings, Jeffrey A. Smith, James Moody, and Daniel McFarland (2023);

-   The [tutorials](https://www.analyzingsocialnetworksusingr.com/home) that accompany the book *Analyzing Social Networks Using R* by Stephen Borgatti, Martin Everett, Jeffrey Johnson and Filip Agneessens;

-   The tutorials available on the [Statnet](https://statnet.org/workshops/) website, created by the Statnet [team](https://statnet.org/about/).
